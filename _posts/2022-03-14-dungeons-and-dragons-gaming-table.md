It's been a while since I've posted something.

This post is about my other passion: Dungeons and Dragons.

I'm a Dungeon Master for a Curse of Strahd campaign that I'm running for some friends. We have been going on for almost a year now with 20 sessions completed to this date. The campaign started online on April 22nd, 2021. Since then we've transitioned to in-person and one aspect of the online game that I really loved was the battle maps.

Using <a href='https://foundryvtt.com/' target='_blank'>FoundryVTT</a>, I was able to show my players images, maps, and handouts. I could also change music at the click of a button. The ease of this made the application invaulable to me. Therefore, I retained the FoundryVTT for our in-person games by displaying the application on a TV as our battle mat.

This had been our experience for our in-person games for most of the campaign. However, this was a hassle as I had to setup and breakdown everything before and after sessions. So, I'd been planning to build a permanent solution for several months.

Laying the TV flat on the table had the TV elevated, causing it to be at an uncomfortable eye-level. I needed a table that had a TV flush with the center of the table. I knew that I didn't want to build a whole new table, so I opted to buy an old dining table and convert it to a gaming table by finishing it and cutting a slot in the center of the table for the TV.

The concept came from this <a href='https://youtu.be/x7L-WF2YZKk' target='_blank'>video</a>.

I purchased the dining table for $50 off Nextdoor. I joined the table and leaf together to form a solid table. Then I measured my TV and cut a slot in the center of the table. The next bit of work was sanding off the old varnish and stain to get to the raw wood. I was using between 60, 120, and 220 grit depending on how much material I needed to sand off. After I got to the raw wood, I used a tack cloth to remove any dust and debris. Then I stained it with Minwax dark walnut stain. After that, I applied polyurethane. Three coats, with light sanding in between layers. After the final coat dried, I used a piece of brown paper bag paper[^1] to remove any bumps and then I buffed the coat with an ultra fine polishing pad to get it smooth and shiny.

All the building supplies cost about $100. This includes the lumber (2@1x3, 2@1x2) new can of stain and polyurethane, jug of mineral spirit, screws, and sandpaper and polishing pad.

I spent more than that on everything, but there was a lot of things that I didn’t end up using. So $100 is the best estimate for everything that I did use. Maybe even a little less. I’d have to go through all my receipts to get an accurate account.

$50 for the table + $100 for supplies = $~$150

This doesn’t include any power tools and equipment you may need.

Tools I used:
- Random orbital sander, with paper in grits of 60, 120, 220
- Circular saw
- Handsaw (to clean up cuts and corners)
- Bessey clamps
- Drill with drill bits for pre hole
- Impact driver
- Shop vac
- Tack cloth
- Ultra fine polishing pad
- Kreg pocket hole jig
- Minwax dark walnut
- Varathane oil polyurethane clear gloss
- Mineral spirit for cleaning brushes
- Bristle/China brush and foam brush
- General construction screws #8 1-1/2” and also #8 2”
- And of course the trusty speed square and tape measure!

This is the result:

1. Join table and leaf together:

2. Sand, stain, polyurethane:

![pre_table_3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/pre_table_3.JPG)
![pre_table_4]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/pre_table_4.JPG)

3. Finish!:
