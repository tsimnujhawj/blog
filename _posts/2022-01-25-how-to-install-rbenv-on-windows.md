> :warning: **_NOTE:_** The title is slightly misleading because we cannot install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) on Windows natively. rbenv is only available on macOS and Linux, but by using Window's [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), we can install rbenv on Windows.

I lied, a little. We can't install rbenv on Windows, but we can install it in a Window's Subsystem for Linux environment, which is even better than on Windows.

Follow the steps to install rbenv on your Window's WSL.

1. Install WSL
  - Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell, as Administrator
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1
```
