My fianc√©e asked me to do yoga with her. I agreed. I agreed because I wanted to say, "yes," to her. I've been trying to say, "yes," more frequently to her because I'm doing an experiment. My hypothesis is that if I say, "yes," to her more often, it'll make her more happy, which in turn would make me more happy. I think it's working so far.

Anyway, the yoga has been extremely helpful in identifying what is wrong with my body. Yoga has helped me to realize that my left ankle is very weak. I've learned from my ankle that our body is a system and if one part is out of alignment, the entire machine will operate sub-optimally. My weak ankle has collapsed my arch, thrown off my balance, damaged my posture, and limited my toe mobility. I didn't know that toe mobility was even important until I had to do a downward dog.

I've also learned that if we use our breath, we can push our physical being. Inhale on rising motion, exhale on falling motion. That's the gist of yoga.
