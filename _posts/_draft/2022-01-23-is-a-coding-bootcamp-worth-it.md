I get asked this question a lot from friends, family, and potential future programmers. I normally tell everyone the same thing: it depends on what your goals are. Then I begin to explain that the coding bootcamp does a good job at putting you through the grinder and providing a template for learning. I continue by explaining that programmers should be autodidacts by nature and that the work requires curious and persistent attitudes who can stare at a wall of headache inducing texts, but pushes on to figure out why a program failed to launch. That programmers should be curious about technology, how it's built, deployed, and affecting our everyday lives. That programmers should have a love for problem solving and analysis.

Then I explain the three groups of graduates. Those who found jobs right after graduation, those who never found jobs, and those who found jobs later on. I happen to be in the last group. And therefore, I could only speak on my experience. Then I share my experience of my job search after the bootcamp. I tell them it took me 6 months of rejection letters after rejection letters. And many more ghosts. 6 months of late nights working on personal projects, learning new tech tools, and becoming more efficient with JavaScript. 6 months of being poor, cold [^1], and tired. 6 months of this until someone noticed my [GitHub](github.com/tsimnujhawj) and the consistency I had over the last year. Perhaps, I could have found a job sooner, but I didn't know any other way. Every rejection and every commit, I tried to learn something new and apply it to my process. This worked for me. I was able to draw attention and was able to break into the industry.

Then I go on to explain how the job market is saturated with junior level programmers, but not to be discouraged because as long as they are passionate about being a programmer and can have realistic expectation about the job market, they will find a job eventually. It just may take longer than they were expecting. This was all in 2018-2019 and maybe the job market is different now, but we hired another software engineer several months ago and it was difficult finding mid-level engineers. There were way more junior level applicants.

I suppose everything I tell people isn't the positive message they were expecting. I try to give the most realistic and useful set of answers that is going to help someone who is interested in becoming a programmer. Bootcamp or not. Everything I tell someone isn't to discourage them. It should have the opposite effect. The person should feel more encouraged and confident, now that they know the reality. Anyone interested in doing something at a professional level should have the courage to bear all the truth, no matter how unassuring it may be, and still proceed. That's my opinion.

## Footnotes
[^1]: This was the year of the [2019 polar vortex](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/climate/journal/cold-outbreak-january-27-31-2019.html) that swept across Minnesota. The house we were renting was an old house with shotty radiators that could barely keep up with a regular Minnesota winter. -55F is a little more than chilly.
