Hi! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This blog is a space to talk about three of my favorite things: fishing, tech, and TTRPGs. These may not seem connected, but for me, they all satisfy the same itch: the thrill of discovery, the love of tinkering, and a need to tell good stories.

Story telling was probably my first obsession. I love building worlds, running games, and bearing witness to the witty and wacky shenanigans players often come up with. There is something very special about gathering people around the table and being able to collectively and collaboratively imagine a world together with dice, paper, and pencil. It's all equal parts chaos, creativity, and camaraderie.

Later came tech. But admittedly, computers were some of the first best friends. I've always liked solving problems, so buildings things, scripts, tools, and websites, just made sense to me. Also, growing up during the era of dial-up, someone in the family needed to the the computer guy. So, I guess I drew the blue screen of responsibility! I'll probably use this space to share what I'm working on, or weird bugs I've fought through so maybe others don't have to.

And then there’s fishing—specifically, kayak fishing. There’s something magical about casting a line into the unknown that never seems to get old. It’s peaceful, yet quietly strategic. Fishing is an attempt to master chaos—tempting the forces of nature with the finesse of lure and bait, hoping to hook a fish for a momentary struggle. It’s the study of weather, water, and fishery—all for the reward of knowing you’ve outwitted nature.

So, why write? Partly to keep track of all the things I’m exploring and learning. Partly to share it with anyone who might find it fun, useful, or even just a little interesting. I don’t have a master plan—I just want a place to write.

If you’re into any of these things, you might like it here. I'll probably bounce between posts about fishing trips, gear, or tactics, programming tips and tricks, homebrew OSR TTRPG content, and whatever else I stumble into.

Thanks for stopping by. Hope you’ll stick around.
